# Hey! I’m Andrew 👋

I’m a software engineer who’s passionate about combining **code**, **creativity**, and **problem-solving** to build things that make life easier and more fun. Whether it’s web apps, trading bots, or LLMs, I love diving into new tech and constantly pushing myself to learn new things.

## 🛠 What I’m working on:
- 🚀 Building [UBCCourses.app](https://ubccourses.app), a **course review platform** designed to help students discover detailed information about their courses.
- 🎙️ Experimenting with **LLMs** to develop a [chrome extension](https://github.com/andrew-fenton/careless-whisperer) that converts speech into text that sounds uniquely like **you**.
- 🎮 Developing an arbitrage trading bot for Counter-Strike skins, which buys and sells across multiple marketplaces to capitalize on price differences.
- 🔮 and some other projects currently in the pipeline...

## 💡 A little about me:
- Currently having a great time watching McLaren bottle the F1 driver's championship 😭.
- During COVID, I may have sunk _a few_ hours into CSGO, climbing my way up to Global Elite.
- I’ve dug into equities and cryptocurrency for over 3 years now, sparking my fascination for **tech** and **finance**.
- I’m always on the lookout for projects that have a real impact on people—whether that’s streamlining processes, solving frustrating problems, or building something exciting from scratch.
- Collaboration is key—I thrive on working, teaching, and learning from others.
