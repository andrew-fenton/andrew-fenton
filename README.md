## 🛠 What I’m working on:
- 🌐 Helping dev teams launch multilingual products faster with [Localization-as-a-Service](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/localization), a centralized API for managing translations across microservices.
- 🚀 Co-built [UBCCourses.app](https://ubccourses.app), a course review platform used by 1K+ students to find in-depth insights on UBC courses.
- 🎮 Developed an arbitrage trading bot for CS skins, buying and selling across P2P marketplaces to capitalize on price inefficiencies.
- 🔧 and some other projects currently in the pipeline...

## 💡 A bit about me:
- During COVID, I sank a few too many hours into CS:GO, reached Global Elite though. Worth it.
- I’ve been deep into equities and crypto for 4+ years now, sparking a long-term fascination with **tech** and **finance**.
