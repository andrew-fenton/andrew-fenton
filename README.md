# Hey! I’m Andrew 👋

## 🛠 What I’m working on:
- 🌐 Helping businesses and developers adapt their products to different languages with [Localization-as-a-service](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/localization).
- 🚀 Building [UBCCourses.app](https://ubccourses.app), a **course review platform** to help students discover detailed information about their courses.
- 🎮 Developing an **arbitrage trading bot** for Counter-Strike skins, which buys and sells across multiple marketplaces to capitalize on price inefficiencies.
- 🔮 and some other projects currently in the pipeline...

## 💡 A little about me:
- Currently having a great time watching McLaren bottle the F1 driver's championship 😭.
- During COVID, I may have sunk _a few_ hours into CSGO, climbing my way up to Global Elite.
- I’ve dug into equities and cryptocurrency for over 3 years now, sparking my fascination for **tech** and **finance**.
- I’m always on the lookout for projects that have a **real impact on people**—whether that’s streamlining processes, solving frustrating problems, or building something meaningful from scratch.
