# Hey! I’m Andrew 👋

I’m a software engineer who’s passionate about combining **code**, **creativity**, and **problem-solving** to build things that make life easier and more fun. Whether it’s web apps, trading bots, or LLMs, I love diving into new tech and constantly pushing myself to learn new things.

## 🛠 What I’m working on:
- 🌐 Helping businesses and developers adapt their products to different languages with [Localization-as-a-service](https://github.com/ubclaunchpad/localization).
- 🚀 Building [ubccourses.app](https://ubccourses.app), a **course review platform** to help students discover detailed information about their courses.
- 🎮 Developing an **arbitrage trading bot** for Counter-Strike skins, which buys and sells across multiple marketplaces to capitalize on price inefficiencies.
- 🔮 and some other projects currently in the pipeline...

## 💡 A little about me:
- Currently having a great time watching McLaren bottle the F1 driver's championship 😭.
- During COVID, I may have sunk _a few_ hours into CSGO, climbing my way up to Global Elite.
- I’ve dug into equities and cryptocurrency for over 3 years now, sparking my fascination with **tech** and **finance**.
- I’m always on the lookout for projects that have a **real impact on people**—whether that’s streamlining processes, solving frustrating problems, or building something meaningful from scratch.

I’m always up for discussing ideas, collaborating on projects, or sharing tips and tricks. Feel free to drop me a message!
